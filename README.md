# Security Castle

In 2013, a paper titled “Bug Catcher: A System for Software Testing Competitions” was published featuring a program to test students’ ability to recognize and identify bugs within problem set. 

As a spiritual successor, Security Castle aims to take the competitive ideas presented in Bug Catcher and instead of focusing on bugs within code, it will focus on the identification and repair of code which features security flaws. While Bug Catcher was designed more with competitions between students in mind, Security Castle looks to adapt to an older audience, focusing on members of the Computer Science workforce to complete the competitions. 

The goal is to spread awareness of different security threats which come up within the code of these developers. By curating a set of problems which feature the most common of these security threats, we can measure the ability for competitors to recognize and remove these threats from the code
